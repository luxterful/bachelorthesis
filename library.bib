abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

@article{Hamilton2014,
abstract = {Previously, video streaming sites were at the fringes of online social media. In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams' contents and participants' shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally, we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media environments to support participatory online communities.},

abstract = {This study investigates why people choose to watch others play video games, on services such as Twitch. Through a questionnaire study (N = 1097), we examine five distinct types of motivations from the uses and gratifications perspective: cognitive, affective, personal integrative, social integrative and tension release. Information seeking is shown to be positively associated with the amount of hours that users chose to spend on the service, as well as the amount of individual streamers they choose to watch. Furthermore, we find that tension release, social integrative and affective motivations are positively associated with how many hours people watch streams. We also find that social integrative motivations are the primary predictor of subscription behaviour. This study lays the groundwork for understanding the motivations to consume this emerging form of new media in the context of online games and video streams.},

abstract = {This article examines cultural and economic behavior on live streaming platform Twitch.tv, and the monetization of live streamers' content production. Twitch is approximately the thirtieth most-viewed website in the world, with over 150 million spectators, and 2 million individuals around the world regularly broadcasting. Although less well-known than Facebook or Twitter, these figures demonstrate that Twitch has become a central part of the platformized Internet. We explore a seven-part typology of monetization extant on Twitch: subscribing, donating and “cheering,” advertising, sponsorships, competitions and targets, unpredictable rewards for viewers, and the implementation of games into streaming channels themselves. We explore each technique in turn, considering how streamers use the affordances of the platform to earn income, and invent their own methods and techniques to further drive monetization. In doing so, we look to consider the particular kinds of governance and infrastructure manifested on Twitch. By governance, we mean how the rules, norms, and regulations of Twitch influence and shape the cultural content both produced and consumed within its virtual borders; and by infrastructure, we mean how the particular technical affordances of the platform, and many other elements besides, structure how content production on Twitch might be made profitable, and therefore decide what content is made, and how, and when. Examining Twitch will thus advance our understanding of the platformization of amateur content production; methodologically, we draw on over 100 interviews with successful live streamers, and extensive ethnographic data from live events and online Twitch broadcasts.},

Traditional training approaches for procurement split the process into separate steps; however, to be able to assess all training aspects, it is important to have a holistic look at procurement. This work explores how well gamification can address the complexity of the procurement process for training specialists in the road construction sector. A case study is carried out to train new business models for both experienced specialists and new employees. The steps for the development of gamification for training in procurement are shown. A comparison of results from experienced and less experienced participants is presented. The results show the relationships amongst the complexity of the real system, the gamification design and the results of gamification.},

abstract = {Empowered by today's rich tools for media generation and collaborative production, the multimedia service paradigm is shifting from the conventional single source, to multisource, to many sources, and now toward crowdsource. Such crowdsourced live streaming platforms as Twitch.tv allow general users to broadcast their content to massive viewers, thereby greatly expanding the content and user bases. The resources available for these non-professional broadcasters however are limited and unstable, which potentially impair the streaming quality and viewers' experience. The diverse live interactions among the broadcasters and viewers can further aggravate the problem. In this paper, we present an initial investigation on the modern crowdsourced live streaming systems. Taking Twitch as a representative, we outline their inside architecture using both crawled data and captured traﬃc of local broadcasters/viewers. Closely examining the access data collected in a two-month period, we reveal that the view patterns are determined by both events and broadcasters' sources. Our measurements explore the unique source- and event-driven views, showing that the current delay strategy on the viewer's side substantially impacts the viewers' interactive experience, and there is signiﬁcant disparity between the long broadcast latency and the short live messaging latency. On the broadcaster's side, the dynamic uploading capacity is a critical challenge, which noticeably aﬀects the smoothness of live streaming for viewers.},

abstract = {Education and psychology studies have used motivational constructs called achievement goals to predict learning success and response to failure. In this article we adapted classroom achievement goal scales to instead measure gaming achievement goals. We collected survey data from 432 university students to empirically examine the applicability and utility of achievement goal constructs from education research to gaming. We introduced a new approach to player types based on mastery and performance gaming achievement goals. Four types are studied: super-achievers, mastery-only, performance-only, and non-achievers. We also examined the relationship between our four achievement goal player types to the traditional achiever, explorer player types. We found that Interest in exploration in games can exist in any of the four types, but those with strong mastery goals have the lowest interest in exploration. Gender and gaming frequency were significantly related to gaming achievement goals. The implications and suggestions for designing games for learning and entertainment are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

Today, some streamers garner audiences larger than big media houses, and services such as the game streaming service Twitch host millions of daily active users. While such activity is often waived merely as a manifestation of video game culture and an extension of online behaviour by adolescents, the phenomenon has begun to generate significant revenue and has managed to shift media consumption behaviour from large commercial organisations towards content created by private individuals. However, we still have a dearth in our understanding on how streamers undertake this activity and what tools they have in their disposal to facilitate successful endeavours in streaming. As this is an activity driven by individuals, are these individuals using vastly different modalities of communication, or have common trends emerged across broadcasters, as they have in traditional media? To build a better understanding of this, we utilize the existing understanding of affordance theory, and analyse the most popular elements and practices employed by streamers in their video streams and profile pages through the investigation of the 100 most popular individual streamers on the Twitch platform. The results show new aspects of social commerce that emerges from the novel forms of online business models of individual online video streamers.},

In its November 2012 press release, Gartner predicts that "by 2015, 40{\%} of Global 1000 organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations". In the same report, they also predict that "by 2014, 80{\%} of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives, primarily due to poor design". What is gamification? Does it belong in the workplace? Are there design best practices that can increase the chance of success of enterprise gamification efforts?

She cautions against taking a "chocolate covered broccoli" approach of simply adding points and badges to business applications and calling them gamified. She outlines a methodology called Player Centered Design which is a practical guide for user experience designers, product managers and developers to incorporate the principles of gamification into their software. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

These Over-The-Top services have recently gained popularity, in particular with e-sport, and can now be seen as competitors of the traditional cable TV. In this paper, we present a dataset for further works on these systems. This dataset contains data on the two main user-generated live streaming systems: Twitch and the live service of YouTube. We got three months of traces of these services from January to April 2014. Our dataset includes, at every five minutes, the identifier of the online broadcaster, the number of people watching the stream, and various other media information. In this paper, we introduce the dataset and we make a preliminary study to show the size of the dataset and its potentials. We first show that both systems generate a significant traffic with frequent peaks at more than 1 Tbps. Thanks to more than a million unique uploaders, Twitch is in particular able to offer a rich service at anytime. Our second main observation is that the popularity of these channels is more heterogeneous than what have been observed in other services gathering user-generated content.},

Personas, a user centered design methodology covers topics from interaction design within IT, through to issues surrounding product design, communication, and marketing.Project developers need to understand how users approach their products from the product's infancy, and regardless of what the product might be. Developers should be able to describe the user of the product via vivid depictions, as if they – with their different attitudes, desires and habits – were already using the product. In doing so they can more clearly formulate how to turn the product's potential into reality.With contributions from professionals from Australia, Brazil, Finland, Japan, Russia, and the UK presenting real-world examples of persona method, this book will provide readers with valuable insights into this exciting research area. The inspiration to create user descriptions includes character-driven narratives, and the film Thelma {\&} Louise is analyzed in order to understand how the development process can also be an engaging story in various professional contexts.With a solid foundation in her own research at the IT University of Copenhagen and more than five years of experience in solving problems for businesses, Lene Nielsen is Denmark's leading expert in the persona method. She has a PhD in personas and scenarios, and through her research and practical experiences she has developed her own approach to the method – 10 Steps to Personas.

This study trialled an eight-factor socio-motivational model, based on Uses and Gratifications Theory, to explain four aspects of live-stream viewer engagement. Cross-sectional data was collected through an international, online self-report survey of Twitch users (N = 2227). Multiple and ordinal linear regression analyses identified six motivations which helped to explain live-stream engagement: social interaction, sense of community, meeting new people, entertainment, information seeking, and a lack of external support in real life. Compared to mass media, viewer motivations to engage in live-stream entertainment appear to have a stronger social and community basis. Furthermore, live-stream viewers who preferred smaller channels ({\textless}500 viewers) were more motivated by social engagement than viewers who preferred larger channels. These findings offer insight into the motivations for live-stream engagement, and help to lay a foundation for further research.},

abstract = {Gamification is the "use of game design elements in non-game contexts" (Deterding et al, 2011, p.1). A frequently used model for gamification is to equate an activity in the non-game context with points and have external rewards for reaching specified point thresholds. One significant problem with this model of gamification is that it can reduce the internal motivation that the user has for the activity, as it replaces internal motivation with external motivation. If, however, the game design elements can be made meaningful to the user through information, then internal motivation can be improved as there is less need to emphasize external rewards. This paper introduces the concept of meaningful gamification through a user-centered exploration of theories behind organismic integration theory, situational relevance, situated motivational affordance, universal design for learning, and player-generated content.},

We empirically investigate this by exploring the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the participation and performance of over 100 undergraduate students in an online gamified learning intervention. The paper makes a number of contributions. First, by synthesizing the literature the central concepts required for a learning intervention to be considered gamified are mapped and the development of an online gamified learning intervention is described. Second, the effect of gamification on learning outcomes is examined using a pre- and post-intervention survey. We find that gamified learning interventions have a positive impact on student learning. Third, our results show that while generally positive, the impact of gamified intervention*ns on student participation varies depending on whether the student is motivated intrinsically or extrinsically. These findings will be of practical interest to teaching and learning practitioners working in a range of educational contexts, and at all levels of education, who wish to increase student engagement and enhance learning.},

abstract = {Currently, gamification is a new trend under which all activities are subsumed that try to introduce game mechanics into non-gaming applications in order to increase user engagement, motivation, and participation. This approach is especially promising in the enterprise domain since enterprise information systems (EIS) mainly focus on efficiency aspects rather than individual long-term motivation and enjoyment. Prior research has shown that these latter variables lead to higher positive organizational outcomes, e.g., job performance. Additionally, first vendors have successfully implemented platforms for gamification. However, these platforms are designed for business-toconsumer (B2C) purposes, require high integration effort and lead to silo-based applications. Requirements for EIS strongly differ from consumer web or desktop applications. Hence, we present a generic platform for enterprise gamification. We derive an architecture for gamification systematically from serviceoriented and event-driven principles and best practices. Based on this architecture, we identify important research challenges for subsequent work. Ultimately, we validate the architecture's feasibility in a prototypical implementation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This experience report describes some recent experiences in user interface design for responsive websites, native mobile applications, and mobile-first designs for a corporation supporting multiple platforms, multiple products, and multiple customer types. In order to situate the information and comparisons, the paper includes discussion of certain supporting methodologies, technologies, skill sets, and approaches typical in each. Some of the expected and perceived benefits and drawbacks to these design methods are discussed in the contexts of various stakeholders. This discussion is not an attempt to define or teach these methodologies, but rather to examine certain relative merits and shortfalls of each in context.},

@article{Sakamoto2014,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new social media infrastructure, named micro-crowdfunding, for motivating people to participate in improving our society. Increasing people's awareness of how they participate in solving serious social problems is central to achieving a sustainable society. Micro-crowdfunding is a new type of community-based crowdsourcing architecture that is based on the micro-level crowdfunding concept and designs the values as a tool for encouraging busy people who live in urban environments to increase their awareness of the importance of participating in activities to improve society through minimal efforts. Because our approach is lightweight and uses a mobile phone, people can participate in micro-crowdfunding activities with little effort anytime and anywhere. After introducing the basic concept of micro-crowdfunding, three scenarios are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of this new social media infrastructure. The first scenario adopts virtual currency, and its basic operation is similar to that of traditional crowdfunding. We analyze how the current design described in the scenarios influences participants in micro-crowdfunding activities and show some pitfalls of the design that cause problems when some users do not find the service valuable. We then present two more scenarios to improve upon the first scenario. The second scenario incorporates virtuality, and the third scenario incorporates fictionality to enhance micro-crowdfunding activities. These scenarios adopt popular strategies used in games to increase people's motivation to participate in more micro-crowdfunding activities. We also analyze how the enhancements influence participants' behavior in the scenarios. Finally, we describe experiences with using a real working prototype system to validate the scenario-based analysis.},
